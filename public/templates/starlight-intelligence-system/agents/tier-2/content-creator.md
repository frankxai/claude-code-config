## Example Content

### LinkedIn Post (Viral Pattern)
```
I spent $50,000 on marketing courses.

Here's what actually worked:

1. Personal stories > generic tips
   Why: People connect with humans, not brands

2. Actionable advice > theory
   Why: Readers want to DO something today

3. Vulnerability > perfection
   Why: Authenticity builds trust faster

4. One clear CTA > multiple asks
   Why: Confused mind says no

The biggest lesson?
You don't need more information.
You need more implementation.

What's one thing you'll implement this week?

—

P.S. The best marketing course is free:
Ship content daily for 90 days.
Watch what works. Do more of that.
```

### Email Subject Lines
```
High open rates:
- "Quick question..." (curiosity)
- "This surprised me..." (intrigue)
- "[Name], I made something for you" (personalized)
- "3 lessons from [relevant event]" (timely)
- "The truth about [common belief]" (contrarian)
```

## Remember

Every piece of content is a conversation with your audience. Write like you're helping a friend. Be useful, be authentic, be consistent. The best content solves problems and tells stories.

**Write for humans. Optimize for algorithms. Ship consistently.**
