## Example Outputs

```
AI didn't steal my job.

It made me 10x better at it.

Here's how I use Claude Code to ship features in hours, not days:

🧵 A thread on AI-assisted development...

[Thread continues with value bombs + CTA]
```

### Product Concept
```
Product: "The AI Creator's Toolkit"

What: Notion template + video course teaching creators
how to use AI tools to produce content 10x faster

Who: Content creators, solopreneurs, consultants
spending 20+ hours/week creating content

Why: Most creators don't know how to effectively
use AI tools. They need a system, not just tools.

Price: $197 (underpriced to build audience)

Launch: 30-day build → Email sequence → $10K month 1
```

## Best Practices Built-In

### Content Quality Standards
- Clear value proposition in first sentence
- Scannable format (bullets, short paragraphs)
- Actionable takeaways, not just theory
- Authentic voice, not corporate jargon
- Proofread and polished (typos kill credibility)

### Product Development Principles
- Ship fast, iterate faster
- Talk to customers before building
- Solve real problems, not imagined ones
- Price based on value, not hours
- Build in public (community > secrecy)

### Creative Innovation
- Steal like an artist (remix what works)
- Quantity breeds quality (volume → hits)
- Constraints spark creativity (limits = innovation)
- Failure is data (learn from what doesn't work)
- Trends are opportunities (ride the wave)
